# Modelling of the TC-NER Pathway Through Parameter Fitting of ODEs
This approach aims to fit the parameters of a 
predefined set of ODEs, which are derived from 
reaction-diffusion systems to be able to model 
change in space and time without the need to rely 
on PDEs. A more detailed description is soon to come.

## Requirements
Please install the following software 
- Python3
- pip3
- singularity (if you want to run the model in a virtual environment)

## Installation of Python libraries
To install the necessary python requirements simply run
```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
